# Hi, I'm Jibran Bohra

I hold an MSc in Theoretical Physics from the University of Cape Town. My journey has taken me from exploring the frontiers of quantum theory to building robust systems in software engineering and quantitative finance.

ðŸ’¡ My interests lie at the intersection of:
- Backend Engineering  
- Data Systems & Pipelines  
- Quantitative Finance & Algorithmic Trading  

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code and well-reasoned architectures. Whether it's designing scalable systems or modeling stochastic processes, I enjoy the blend of theory and application.
